  ## Structure and main files
  
  Each chapter of the book has its own folder with R Markdown files and outputs:
  
  ```bash
📁 Gentle-Introduction-to-R/
  ├── 📄 introduction_to_R.Rmd          # Main R Markdown file (base R introduction)
├── 📁 data/                          # Example datasets
  │   ├── 📄 athletes_data.csv          # Example dataset used in the tutorial
│   ├── 📄 modified_athletes_data.csv # Output dataset generated by the code
└── 📁 figures/                       # Graphs generated in section 5
  
  
  Now, we're gonna see how to reproduce, step by step

# 1. Download or clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/statskaren/Gentle-Introduction-to-R.git

# 2. Open in RStudio:  
Open the introduction_to_R.Rmd file in RStudio.

# 3.Run the code:
rmarkdown::render("introduction_to_R.Rmd")

# 4. Explore and modify the code:
#You can modify the rmarkdown file and save as a R script, for example.
#Feel free to modify the code, change variables, or replace the example dataset (athletes_data.csv) with your own data.

# 5. Share and collaborate:
#If you find any errors or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
